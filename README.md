# Espresso Insight

Impresso Espresso, a coffee roastery, would like to introduce a new and playful menu to improve their user engagements and sales. A prospective idea was nominated from the brainstorming session and they’re in dire need of your engineering expertise with the implementation! We’d like you to develop a simple proof of concept that determines which beverage would a customer be more inclined to buy given the users and beverages data.
● Derive a “compatibility score” calculation as to how well a product would suit a user’s preference.
● Create a web application that predicts each user’s potential go-to beverage and report any additional insights, if any.
